# Professional Summary

My experience in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) has played a crucial role in shaping my professional aspirations and values, preparing me to be a valuable asset to future employers. This ePortfolio showcases my ability to plan, develop, and deliver industry-standard software solutions. While it doesn’t cover all the work I’ve completed during my degree, it highlights my skills in three key areas:

1. **Software Engineering and Design**
2. **Data Structures and Algorithms**
3. **Databases**

## Project 1: Software Engineering and Design

In the first part of my capstone project, I completely revamped the front-end of the Global Traveler application. The original version, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, had several limitations, including an outdated design and the challenge of maintaining hard-coded content. I re-engineered the front-end using **Next.js 14**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This overhaul resulted in a modern, scalable, and visually appealing interface that’s easier to maintain and update.

### Key Outcomes:

- **Enhanced Visual Appeal**: Tailwind CSS helped me create a clean, user-friendly design.
- **Improved Maintainability**: With Next.js and TypeScript, updates are seamless and don’t require extensive downtime.
- **Scalability**: The component-based architecture of Next.js ensures the application can grow and evolve efficiently.

## Project 2: Data Structures and Algorithms

The second part of the project involved implementing custom sorting functionality within the Global Traveler application. Initially, sorting was handled by MongoDB’s built-in functions, which were effective but lacked transparency. To gain better control, I implemented the **Quick Sort** algorithm to sort travel options by price. This custom implementation deepened my understanding of algorithms and their practical applications.

### Key Outcomes:

- **Enhanced Algorithmic Understanding**: Implementing Quick Sort gave me hands-on experience with applying data structures and algorithms in a real-world setting.
- **Improved User Functionality**: Users can now sort travel options by ascending or descending price, improving the overall user experience.

## Project 3: Database Integration

The final enhancement involved shifting from static data management to a dynamic, database-driven approach. Originally, the "Destinations" page was populated with hard-coded data from a JSON file, which was neither scalable nor flexible. By integrating **MongoDB** as the backend database, I transformed the application to deliver dynamic, up-to-date content. This allowed the Global Traveler application to expand its data capabilities and provide users with a more interactive and informative experience.

### Key Outcomes:

- **Dynamic Content Delivery**: MongoDB enabled real-time content updates, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **Scalability**: The application can now easily incorporate new data and features, supporting future growth.
- **Improved User Interaction**: Transitioning to dynamic data management made the site more responsive to user needs.

## Course Outcomes

### Outcome 1: Collaborative Environments

I developed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in computer science. A key example is my extensive use of Git and GitHub throughout the course. These tools are essential in the real world for collaborating with developers, cross-functional teams, and stakeholders. They allowed me to manage version control efficiently, ensuring that all team members could contribute effectively.

### Outcome 2: Professional Communication

I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. Throughout the course, I documented my work in weekly milestones and journals, reflecting on my progress and outlining my thought process. These documents were written to be accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences. Additionally, I provided clear instructions in README files for accessing the original and enhanced versions of my projects and deployed my web application on Vercel to make it easily accessible.

### Outcome 3: Computing Solutions

I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve specific problems using algorithmic principles and computer science practices while managing trade-offs in design choices. This was evident in my first enhancement, where I addressed the limitations of an initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website by choosing Next.js for server-side rendering, Tailwind CSS for styling, and TypeScript for improved code quality. I carefully planned the architecture, focusing on scalability, correctness, and readability to ensure the web app could grow and adapt to future needs.

### Outcome 4: Innovative Techniques and Tools

I demonstrated the ability to use innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement solutions that deliver value and meet industry-specific goals. By utilizing Next.js 14, I took advantage of a powerful React framework that supports server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes. Implementing Tailwind CSS allowed for efficient, responsive design, and using TypeScript showed my commitment to type-safe, high-quality code. This transition from a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript stack to a modern tech stack illustrates my adaptability and problem-solving abilities.

### Outcome 5: Security Mindset

I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and design to expose vulnerabilities, mitigate flaws, and ensure the privacy and security of data. When connecting my database, I focused on protecting it from unauthorized access by implementing API key authentication and storing sensitive information in environment variables. I also included middleware to validate API keys before processing requests, ensuring a secure and centralized approach to access control.
